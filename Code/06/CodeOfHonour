We declare that the code submitted by us has been developed by us. Other than the code supplied for this course, we have not borrowed any piece of code from any source, be it the code developed by our class-mates, or code available from other students, or the code available on internet. We are aware of the fact that if any evidence to the contrary is discovered, the matter will be reported to the D-DAC with a recommendation of the harshest punishment possible.

We agree to discussion among other teams for possible test cases and corner cases.
